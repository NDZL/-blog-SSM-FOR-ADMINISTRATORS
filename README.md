Title: "Unlocking Efficiency: Driving Zebra Secure Storage Manager Adoption in Staging Operations with Android 13" 

 

In the fast-paced world of enterprise technology, staying ahead of the curve is essential. Zebra Technologies is leading the charge with its innovative approach to storage solutions, particularly through the adoption of Secure Storage Manager (SSM) in Staging Operations with the latest Android 13. In this guide, we'll delve into the key aspects of this technology and how it benefits developers, staging designers, and businesses alike. 


## Understanding Secure Storage Manager (SSM) 

Secure Storage Manager (SSM) is a powerful tool designed by Zebra Technologies to address and overcome storage-related concerns. In essence, SSM provides a secure channel for transmitting data between applications, ensuring confidentiality through features like optional pre-encryption and auto-decryption. This shared resource manages multiple connections and pieces of data, making it a versatile solution for both developers and staging designers. 

### Benefits for Developers 

Developers can leverage SSM to enhance their applications with features like: 

- Differentiation for data types (files and key/value pairs) 

- Optional pre-encryption support and auto-decryption for secure data transmission 

- Notifications for real-time updates on new data availability 

- Persistence across OS Enterprise Reset for saving data for future instances 

 
### Empowering Staging Designers 

Even non-developers can start using SSM in staging workflows, thanks to its user-friendly configuration. The guide provides step-by-step instructions on configuring various Zebra tools like Datawedge, Enterprise Browser, Device Diagnostic Tool, Application Manager, and Enterprise Keyboard to seamlessly integrate with SSM. 


## Configuring Zebra Tools for SSM Adoption 

 

The guide outlines the detailed process of configuring different Zebra tools for SSM adoption in Staging Operations: 

 

1. **Datawedge Configuration:** Setting up profiles for Datawedge to deploy files for applications using SSM. 

 

2. **Enterprise Browser Configuration:** Deploying files for Enterprise Browser applications using SSM.
